I finally decided to update my github page. I needed some place to host all of my blogs together as well as a portfolio site. 
# Sidebar
The sidebar on the right catches all headers in the blog text and updates as you scroll.
# header 2
# header 3
# header 4
# header 5
# header 6
# header 7
Will need to transform this to a mobile layout though.
