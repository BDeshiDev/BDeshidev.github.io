      A modular Behavior Tree and Finite State machine library for Unity3D that lets you define states, and BT nodes and manages state transitions purely via code.
      Inspired to merge FSM and BT by the following GDC talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq_xX1JCreI 
    work:
      - Wrote Parallel, Selector, Squence etc BT nodes and several custom ones
      - Wrote a flexible <strong>Hierarchical Finite State machine framework</strong> that works with behavior trees.
      - BT and FSM can be <strong>constructed/modified in runtime</strong>.
      - Wrote <strong>Unity Editor code</strong> for a custom editor window for <strong>runtime debugging the FSM/BT</strong>. 
    roles:
      - Gameplay programming
      - AI programming
